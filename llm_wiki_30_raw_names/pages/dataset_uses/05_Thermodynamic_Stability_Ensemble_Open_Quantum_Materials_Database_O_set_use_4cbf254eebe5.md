# 05_Thermodynamic_Stability_Ensemble - Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD)

## Dataset Use

A DFT-generated database of predicted inorganic materials, providing formation energies and structural data for over 400,000 compounds. Used alongside MP and JARVIS for cross-database performance validation of ECSG, particularly to assess robustness under class imbalance (11.3% stable samples) and to serve as a reference convex hull for DFT validation of predicted perovskite oxides.

## Task Context

Predicting the thermodynamic stability of inorganic compounds by classifying them as stable or unstable based on decomposition energy (ΔHd), where compounds with ΔHd ≤ 0 meV/atom (or relaxed thresholds of 25/40 meV/atom) are labeled stable — enabling high-throughput screening of viable candidates in unexplored compositional spaces.
